===== D Mist =====

==== Summary ====
The D.Mist fight is pretty straightforward, but at times can be a significant time sink.  As long as you never attack while D.Mist is in mist form, only one PC can ever be knocked per attack, and you have a good chunk of recovery time while D.Mist is in mist form.  This is a great time to wake people up, re-apply blink, use Bluff.

Fast actions (attack, nuke, virus, item tosses) are generally preferable to slower actions (jump, power, tier 3 spells). However, you can time the queuing of slower actions during mist phase to have them resolve when D.Mist has transformed back into a vulernable form.

At low level, life potions, blink, and perseverance can win the day as long as you're not at speed deficit.

D.Mist is a great target for high-powered darts, since you won't want to berserk until you think you'll end the fight in that vulnerable phase.
